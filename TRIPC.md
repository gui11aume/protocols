4C on barcoded kc167 cells 
Adapted from Stadhouders R. et al (Nature protocols 8, 2013) by Arantxa Rosado

I take 10M cells at 1M/ml density in 10 ml

Add 0.275 ml (1% final) of 37% formaldehyde per 10 ml suspension 
To 10 ml of cell suspension + formaldehyde, add 0.60 ml of a 2.5M Glycin stock 
Incubate for 10 min. at room temperature (RT) under rotation. 
(Glycine stocks are prepared in MilliQ, filtered and stored for max. 1 month at RT).
Incubate for 5 min at RT under rotation. 
Fixed cells are transferred to ice and kept cold from now on.  
Pellet the cells at 300xg for 5 min at 4°C.  
Discard all the supernatant and resuspend pellet in cold PBS (1ml/5-million cells). 
Transfer to 1.5 ml safe-lock tubes. 
Pellet the cells at 300xg for 5 min at 4°C, discard supernatant. Optional: At this point 
cells might be store by  snap-freezing the pellets in liquid nitrogen. Store at -80°C
Gently resuspend the cell pellet in 0.25 ml freshly prepared ice-cold Hi-C lysis buffer: 
To prepare 5 ml of Hi-C lysis buffer combine: 

50 μl 1M Tris-HCl pH8.0 
10 μl 5M NaCl 
100 μl 10% Igepal CA630 
100 μl 50x Roche complete protease inhibitors (in PBS or MilliQ) 
4.74 ml MilliQ water 

Incubate the cells for at least 15 min on ice  

Centrifuge at 1000xg for 5 min at 4°C.  
Wash pelleted nuclei with 500 μl cold  lysis buffer. 
Gently resuspend pellet in 50 μl of 0.5% SDS in 1x NEB2 buffer (5 μl 10x CutSmart 
buffer + 42.5 μl nuclease-free water + 2.5 μl 10% SDS) and incubate at 62°C for 10 
min. 

Remove tubes from the heating block, add 170 μl of 1x CutSmart buffer containing 25 
μl of 10% Triton X-100 (17 μl 10x CutSmart buffer + 128 μl nuclease-free water + 25 μl 
10% TX-100) to quench the SDS. Mix well by pipetting, avoiding excessive foaming. 

Incubate at 37°C for 15 min. 

Add 25 μl of 1X CutSmart buffer, mix by inverting and take a 8 μl control 

aliquot. Add 100 U of NlaIII restriction enzyme (10μl of a 10U/μl stock) to the 
remaining nuclei and digest chromatin for 3-4 hours at 37°C under rotation.  
After 3-4 hours, add another 100 U and incubate under rotation overnight at 

37°C. 
 Optional:Take 8ul aliquote and de-crosslink it by adding 80ul of TE buffer and 
5ul of prot K (20mg/ul), heat at 65C for 1h and run on a 1% agarose gel

Add another 50 U of enzyme to the samples and incubate for 3-4 more hours at

37°C under rotation 

Heat-inactivate the NlaIII enzyme 20’ at 65°C 
Spin 5’ @ 1000 xg, remove sup and resuspend pellet in 300 ul of fresh 1X 

NEB2 

Add 900 ul ligation buffer and 5 ul of Roche T4 DNA Ligase (5U/ul)\  incubate 

overnight at 16°C   under rotation .

Add 50ul of proteinase K (20mg/ul) and 10ul of RNAse A, incubate 1h at 55°C 

and then 4h at 65°C 

Split each sample in two 600ul aliquotes and purify with 1:1 phenol-chloroform-
isoamylalcohol, then precipitate by adding: 2ul glycogen + 60ul NaAC 3M + 2.5
volumes of absolute ethanol. Optional: Samples might be stored at -80°C 

Centrifuge at max speed for 25 min 
Wash the pellet with 500ul 75% EtOH, and resuspend the pellet in 100 ul 

water, take 8ul aliquot and run on gel to check if ligation worked. 

Put together the 2 aliquots and digest with 50U MluCI in 300ul total volume 

overnight at 37°C 

MluCI cannot be heat inactivated so it is necessary to do a purification:
Add 500 ll Phenol–Chloroform and mix vigorously; 
Spin 10 min, 16,400g at RT; 
Transfer the aqueous phase to a fresh tube and add:

50 ul 2 M NaAc pH 5.6 and 950 ul 100% EtOH;  Incubate at 80°C until 

completely frozen; 

Spin 20 min 16,400g at 4 °C
Remove supernatant and add 150 ul cold 70% ethanol
Spin 10 min 16,400g at 4°C
Resuspend the pellet in 150ul of water 
Transfer sample to a 50 ml tube and add: 

12.1 ml Milli-Q; 
1.4 ml 10x Ligation buffer (home-made) 
100 U T4 DNA Ligase. 
Ligate overnight at 16°C

Precipitate the ligation by adding: 

1,4ml 3M NaAc 
35ml absolute EtOH  
10ul glycerol 

Mix well and keep at -80°C for at least 2h. Optional: Samples might be stored at 

-80°C for later processing.

Centrifuge for 45 min 
Wash with 10ml cold 75% EtOH 
Resuspend in 150ul TE and purify with Quiagen PCR purification kit 
Elute twice in 50ul EB
